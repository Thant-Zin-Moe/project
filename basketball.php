                <h1>Getting started with basketball</h1><br><br>
                <p>
                    Although official games of basketball require 10 players, you can play a game of basketball with just one other person. You can also go out and shoot baskets by yourself.
                    If you want to play basketball competitively, you can become a member of a team and get involved in local competition. Check out your local sports centres and associations
                    for information on how to join a team, or start your own.
                </p>

                <li>A soccer ball was originally used to play basketball!</li>
                <li>Dr. James Naismith invented the game when he was looking for ways to keep his gym
                    class busy on a rainy day.</li>
                <li>Originally, two teams of 9 players played the game the same as baseball- but later on
                    the number of the players was reduced and it came to 5 players on each team! </li>
                <li>The backboard was invented, because at first basketball hoops were nailed to the
                    mezzanine balcony of the court and spectators in the balcony continually interfered with
                    shots!</li>
                <li>When the game was played at first, dribbling was not a large part !</li>

                <li>Basketball players used to play in the early 1900s, in cages of chicken wire and mesh so

                    &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How much of an explanation do you need here? Of course Michael Jordan is No. 1. This man won three in a row,
                    left to play baseball, then came back to win three in a row again, and then he came back one more time and was one of the oldest players to
                    average 20 PPG and to score 40-plus in a game. The GOAT, no question. But I'm still going to remind you that he never played in a Finals Game 7
                    in six appearances and won a Defensive Player of the Year award ('88) along with his five MVPs, six Finals MVPs, and was named to the NBA's 75th anniversary
                    team. He played at the highest level on both sides of the floor and like Bill Russell before him knew exactly what he had to do to help his team win day in and day out.!<br>

                <h1> <u>Advantages of playing basketball</u></h1>
                <p>
                    Basketball is one of the most popular sports in the world and one of the most widely viewed. It is a team sport that involves two teams of five active players
                    each trying to score points against one another by throwing a ball through a 300 cm (10 feet) high hoop (the ‘basket’) under organised rules. It is played on
                    both indoor and outdoor courts.The size of the court, height of the basket, size of the basketball, and length of time that the game is played, can all vary
                    according to the age, size and skill level of players.Basketball is a fast moving game that involves a lot of variety, including shooting, dribbling, passing,
                    rebounding, defence and much more.
                </p>
                <h2><u>Health Benefits of Basketball</u></h2>
                <p>
                    Basketball involves a lot of starting and stopping. While not renowned as an aerobic sport, it is still a great workout that can help you:
                <ul>
                    <li>burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630-750 calories)</li>
                    <li>build endurance & improve balance and coordination</li>
                    <li>develop concentration and self-discipline</li>
                    <li>build up muscle.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h2> <u>Other Benefits of Basketball </u></h2>
                <p>
                    As well as being a great way to stay fit, basketball can also:
                <ul>
                    <li>help you to make new friends and see them regularly teach you about being a good team player</li>
                    <li>be played by people of all ages and all abilities</li>
                    <li>be played all year round because it's usually an indoor sport</li>
                    <li>be a fun game that kids of all levels and ages can enjoy</li>
                    <li>be practiced alone -all you need is a ball and a hoop (and you can find a hoop in most local parks and school grounds)</li>
                    <li>be played and enjoyed with as few as two people (although official games require 10 players).</li>
                </ul>
