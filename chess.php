    <div>The game of chess we know today has been around since the 15th century where it became popular in Europe.
    Chess is a game played between two opponents on opposite sides of a board containing 64 squares
    of alternating colors. Each player has 16 pieces: 1 king, 1 queen, 2 rooks, 2 bishops, 2 knights,
    and 8 pawns. The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. Checkmate happens when the king is 
    in a position to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.”</div><br>
